    <h1>More About Me!</h1>
    <div class="fact-card">
      <div class="emoji">🏊 Swimming</div>
      <p>I'm a <strong>professional swimmer</strong> representing Shanghai, and swimming has been my passion for nearly 8 years. I've won countless medals for my city and my school, which I keep on a special wall for motivation. Still, the journey hasn’t been easy — I’ve torn shoulder ligaments, fractured my elbow, and sprained my ankle — but through every setback, I’ve always returned to the water, stronger and faster.</p>

      <div class="emoji">🌌 Astronomy</div>
      <p>I’m deeply fascinated by the universe. There’s so much humanity has yet to discover — from black holes to neutron stars and strange matter. In my spare time, I like to stargaze with a telescope in my backyard and explore what lies beyond this world.</p>

      <div class="emoji">📊 Stocks & Investment</div>
      <p>I've been learning stocks and investing since I was 10 with my Dad. I've bought stocks, analyzed market trends, studied companies, and learned how financial systems work! It’s a field that challenges me to think strategically and stay informed. Like astronomy, it is something I enjoy doing in my leisure time.</p>

      <div class="emoji">💡 Tech</div>
      <p>As you may already know, I love building meaningful tech that can not only help me learn, but also make a positive impact! For instance, I've built a voice interactive chatbot called <strong><a href="https://github.com/JLW-7/wally-c" target="_blank">Wally</a></strong> that helps users remember essential items, assists with daily tasks, and offers emotional support. Another project, a versatile <a href="https://numeracalc.com/" target="blank">calculator web app</a> I made when I first explored programming, has now 1000+ clicks and helped over 100+ users from 9+ countries!</p>
