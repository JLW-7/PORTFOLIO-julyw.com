# JulyW.com

[**julyw.com**](https://julyw.com) is my personal portfolio website — a space where I introduce who I am, what I love, and the projects I’ve built. It’s a hub for my favorite work, creative ideas, and experiments in tech, design, and beyond.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: for basic layout (e.g. website content)
- **CSS & Tailwind CSS**: for styling (e.g. animations)
- **Javascript**: for interactivity (e.g. custom cursor)

## Contributing
