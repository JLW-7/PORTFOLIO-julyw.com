# JulyW.com

[**julyw.com**](https://julyw.com) is my personal portfolio website â€” a space where I introduce who I am, what I love, and the projects Iâ€™ve built. Itâ€™s a hub for my favorite work, creative ideas, and experiments in tech, design, and beyond.

## Tech Stack
- **HTM**L: for basic layout (e.g. website content)
- **CSS**: for styling (e.g. animations)
- **JS**: for interactivity (e.g. custom cursor)

Yep, I know, the classic HTML + CSS + JS ðŸ˜‰
